Data harmonisation in Space-Time-Taxonomy, Data gaps and biases 

All identified biodiversity and environmental data in the data catalogue should be made interoperable in space-time-taxonomy. To facilitate analyses on the data it's essential to map data gaps and data biasesfor the taxonomic groups under 
analysis. E.g. birds have the best coverage, whereas pollinators are still strongly biased to North-Western Europe. As continued data streams are linked to the infrastructure these gaps and biases should be identified on-the-fly making use of the latest taxonomically standardized data. The data that is requested for analysis by a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is harmonised, cropped, and delivered as multidimensional array structures organised into relevant and compatible dimensions, including time, geography and taxonomy (i.e. a data cube). This will allow users to perform complex queries, slice-and-dice operations, and drill-down analysis to explore intricate relationships and patterns in the data across these different dimensions.
