# Results Directory

This directory contains the analysis outputs generated by the
*Biodiversity Meets Data (BMD)* project.

Results are organised into two main categories:

---

## 1. Filtering Summary Reports

Located in: results/filtering/

Generated by: src/core/02_filter_gbif_dataset.py

Includes three summary reports:

- `GBIF_BIRDS_summary_report.txt`
- `GBIF_HABITATS_summary_report.txt`
- `GBIF_IAS_summary_report.txt`

Each report contains:

- total raw occurrence records  
- records retained after filtering  
- unique species and taxonKeys  
- geographic coverage  
- coordinate ranges  
- temporal range  
- basis-of-record distribution  
- filtering parameters used  

These diagnostic reports are lightweight and safe to store in Git.

## 2. Natura2k Analysis Outputs

Located in: results/natura2k/<DATASET_NAME>/

Generated by:

- `04_basic_metrics_gbif_natura.py`
- `05_advanced_metrics_gbif_natura.py`

### Output files include:

#### Site-level metrics (per SITECODE)
- occurrences inside each Natura site  
- distinct species  
- temporal coverage  

#### Member-State-level metrics (per MS)
- occurrences within Natura sites  
- number of sites with data  
- number of species  
- temporal range  

#### Species-level metrics (per taxonKey)
- occurrences in Natura sites  
- number of Natura sites  
- number of Member States  
- temporal span and completeness  

#### Site-type-level metrics (per SITETYPE)
- occurrences  
- species richness  
- temporal coverage  

#### Temporal gap metrics (per SITECODE)
- expected vs. observed years  
- missing years  
- gap fraction  

All outputs are exported as CSV files.

## Notes

- Raw and filtered datasets are not stored in this folder.  
- Only final analysis outputs (CSV summaries) are committed.  
- Additional result types may be added as Task 3.3 progresses.
