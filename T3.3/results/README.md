# Results Directory

This directory contains the analysis outputs generated by the
*Biodiversity Meets Data (BMD) - T3.3* project.

At this stage, all results come from the GBIF filtering pipeline and are
stored in the `filtering/` subfolder.

## Filtering Summary Reports

The `filtering/` folder includes the summary reports created by the script
`02_filter_gbif_dataset.py` for the three dataset groups used in the project:

- Birds Directive species (BIRDS)
- Habitats Directive species (HABITATS)
- Invasive Alien Species of Union Concern (IAS)

### Files included
- `GBIF_BIRDS_summary_report.txt`
- `GBIF_HABITATS_summary_report.txt`
- `GBIF_IAS_summary_report.txt`

Each summary report provides:

- total number of raw occurrence records  
- records retained after filtering  
- number of unique species and taxonKeys  
- geographic coverage (countries)  
- coordinate ranges (latitude/longitude)  
- temporal coverage (year range)  
- basis-of-record breakdown  
- all filtering parameters applied (e.g., coordinate uncertainty threshold)

These files are small, human-readable diagnostics intended for auditing
the filtering process. They do **not** contain raw GBIF data, so they are
safe to store in the repository.

## Notes
As the project grows, additional result types (e.g., spatial outputs,
Natura 2000 analyses, plots) may be added here.  
For now, the directory contains only filtering summaries.
