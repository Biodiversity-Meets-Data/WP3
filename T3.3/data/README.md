## Contents
- **raw/**  
  Contains raw, unmodified GBIF downloads (DwC-A ZIP files).  
  These files are not edited manually and are excluded from Git.

- **filtered/**  
  Contains cleaned datasets produced by the filtering pipeline.  
  Includes:
  - Filtered occurrence CSV
  - Summary report from the filtering process

- **external/**  
  Contains links to external datasets (e.g., Natura 2000 polygons).  
  Actual data files are stored outside the repository due to size/licensing.

## Notes
- Raw and filtered datasets are *not* committed to Git.  
- Only metadata files (like this README and link lists) are tracked.  
- All datasets are generated by scripts in `src/core/`.
