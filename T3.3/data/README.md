## Contents

### **raw/**
Contains raw, unmodified GBIF downloads (DwC-A ZIP files).  
Generated by `01_download_gbif.py`.  
Not committed to Git due to size/licensing.

### **filtered/**
Contains cleaned GBIF datasets produced by `02_filter_gbif_dataset.py`.  
Each dataset folder (e.g., `IAS/`, `BIRDS/`, `HABITATS/`) includes:
- Filtered occurrence CSV (or ZIP)
- Filtering summary report

### **external/**
Contains reference datasets that are not generated by the project  
(e.g., official Natura 2000 polygon files).  
Actual data files are stored outside the repository; only READMEs or link lists are tracked.

### **processed/**
Contains intermediate derived datasets created during analysis, including:
- `natura2k_prepared.gpkg` (cleaned Natura 2000 polygons)
- Spatial join results under:
  `data/processed/<DATASET_NAME>/GBIF_<DATASET_NAME>_with_natura_sites.gpkg`
